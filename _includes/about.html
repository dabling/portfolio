                    <p>Creative. Hybrid. Loyal. Team Player. Compassionate. These are words that would describe who I am, but I think the best word that I truly identify with is <em>creative</em>. I unleash my creativity in various areas in my personal and professional life: whether it's being creative with code, in solving problems, on the dance floor, with musical instruments, or with a graphite pencil (or Apple pen). </p>

                    <p>While I love being creative, I'm also pretty good at other things too, like marketing and front-end development. I'm armed with a passionate mindset, flowing ideas and a team mentality, I'm ready to tackle challenges with creativity and determination.</p>
